## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to understand the general crime trends as well as help answer specific critical questions about crime in the United States. Furthermore, the U.S. crime data provided ranges from 2005 to 2016, and examines crime at the state level, county level, across various crime types, and different motivations for committed crimes. The project's presentation will take the format of a Shiny application using libraries including dplyr, markdown, shiny, ggplot2, shinyBS, plotly, and maps. The user interactive presentation involves both textual and visual U.S. crime data representations.

## Special Instructions
The "Home" tab of this application presents a general overview of our project, including its main goals. The next four tabs includes textual and visual explanations to the corresponding critical questions about the data set that are listed in the "Home" section. The last tab, which is "References", provides links to the original data set, lists the application's authors, and describes the packages/libraries used in the application.
